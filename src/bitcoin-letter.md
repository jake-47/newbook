# Bitcoin letter
---

## Dear friends and family
If you don't own any bitcoin yet, buy some. 
I'll say that again. 
Buy some bitcoin. 
You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. 
You can buy a fraction of it. 
So, buy some bitcoin.

Buy it with money you are willing to lose. Don't upgrade your phone or you laptop this year. Maybe give up a vacation, but buy some bitcoin. 
Sure, Bitcoin is speculative. 
I wouldn't be telling you about it if it were not. But think of it this way. If Bitcoin achieves its goal (become global money), you'd have gained 10x to a 100x or more of what you put in (provided you buy some soon). If it fails, then you lose how much ever you were willing to lose in the first place. Bitcoin is the biggest asymmetrical bet you can make today. 

Now it is important to note that Bitcoin is not a get-rich scheme, although many think of it that way. It's much more than that. It's freedom tech, and it's the most important invention since the printing press. And you don't want to be the last person holding a bag of worthless cash or investments while the rest of the world moves on to a better money.

So, here's a bitcoin-buying strategy that I recommend (each step is explained in more detail below):
1. Using best practices, get a bitcoin wallet (explained below).
2. Buy a fraction of a bitcoin with money you are willing to lose; basically, put a small percentage of your investment portfolio in bitcoin. If you have no investments, now is a good time to start.
3. Do your research. Understand the technology behind Bitcoin. If you are convinced, then buy some more. But beware, the bitcoin rabbit-hole can quickly turn into a mind virus, captivate your imaginations, and consume your time.
4. _Optional_: Forget about bitcoin. Maybe you have more important things to do then to think about how money works. No problem. It's not a bad idea to buy some bitcoin and forget about the purchase (not your keys) until Bitcoin accomplishes its goal—become a global medium of exchange (when your employer starts paying you in bitcoin and your local kinara starts accepting it). Many bitcoiners advise starting with step 3, i.e., do you research, and then buy bitcoin. Sure, you could start there. But then start today. Stop putting it off. With every passing moment, your savings are evaporating.

## Get a bitcoin wallet
It's easy to shoot yourself in the foot when dealing with bitcoin. I won't go into the details, because this is a letter, and there's tons of resources available online on how to safely create a wallet. I recommend you get yourself a desktop wallet like [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and even consider using a multisig setup like [this](https://freedomnode.com/blog/how-to-setup-a-secure-multisig-wallet-on-iphone-with-coldcard-tapsigner-and-nunchuk/). For small amounts, I recommend [Aqua](https://aqua.net/), a mobile wallet. There's trade-offs which each wallet, and all this can get complicated really fast; so do your research or feel free to reach out to me if you're having trouble.

After creating a wallet, it is imperative that you delete it and attempt to restore it using your keys (and check the fingerprint to see if you've restored the right wallet). If you lose your keys, you have lost your bitcoin forever. There is no bank you can go to and recover the password. Since Bitcoin removes the middle-man, ownership comes with a cost — you have to be responsible for your keys. It's crucial that you're thoroughly familiar with recovering a wallet, and it's crucial that keep your keys (password) safe. Never type it, never take a picture, and never print it. The recommended method for storing your keys is to record them on multiple pieces of paper or etch them onto steel plates, and then securely store them in different locations (think different cities).

## Buy bitcoin
Once you have created your wallet securely, buy some bitcoin. Here too there are myriad of pitfalls. Avoid linking your wallet to your real-life identity. In other words, avoid buying your bitcoin from centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, WazirX, etc.); exchanges require your KYC (identity), and linking your wallet to your real-life identity is not unwise, to say the least.

Buy Bitcoin directly from third-party traders. You can find such traders on websites such as localbitcoins or hodlhodl or on decentralized exchanges such as bisq or robosats. Daunting? It is the first few times, but this labour is profitable. Again, if you are not sure what you are doing, please reach out to me.

As a word of caution, there are a lot of crypto scams riding on Bitcoin's glory. Stay away form anything crypto that is not Bitcoin. We are in the early days of the blockchain technology, and there are a lot of scammers taking advantage of the widespread lack of knowledge. In a free market, the economy will eventually tend to one money. After all, the very purpose of money is to increase the number of people you can trade with. The only reason why the silver was used during the gold standard was because it was difficult to scale gold. Since bitcoin is digital, unlike gold, it needs no auxiliary money. So, the future has only one money. And very smart people have come and studied where to store their wealth. Bitcoin is the clear winner. Compare the price difference between bitcoin and the second crypto-currency. And once you dive into the technology, your conviction will only grow. So, apart from bitcoin, stay away from anything crypto. 

Finally, if you already own some bitcoins on some exchanges, then with the utmost urgency withdraw them into your own custodial wallet. Remember the maxim: not your keys, not your bitcoins.

## Study bitcoin
Now Bitcoin is not easy to understand, for it is multifaceted and at the crossroads of game theory, cryptography, computer science, networking and data transmission, and economic and monetary theory. There's quite a bit of reading you will have to do to fully understand the underlying technology. But remember how one eats an elephant (one bite at a time)? In the meanwhile, here's a primer to help you intuitively understand the big picture.

The first thing to understand is the primary purpose of money — be a store of value. Food stores calorie energy. If stored properly, it can hold calorie energy for a long time. Wood stores heat energy. If stored properly, it can store heat energy for a very long time. Tapes, CDs and mp3 files store sonic energy. Each have varying degrees of difficulty in storing sonic energy, but if stored properly, they can hold sonic energy for a significantly long period of time. Money stores value energy. It converts your labour (time and energy used productively to create value for someone else) into something (paper, metal, beads, salt, etc.) that you can later exchange for other goods and services.

Second, it's important to understand that not all types of money are equal. Just as not all cultures are equal, some are better than others, some money stores value energy better than others. For the last 5000 years, gold has been the undisputed king of money; it's only since the last 100 years or so that paper money has taken over (more on this later). But why, you may ask, has gold been the dominant money? Why is silver less valuable than gold even though it shares the same properties? Silver, like gold, is durable (non corrosive), it's fungible (one silver coin is equal to another silver coin of the same weight, but it's not so with diamonds for example), it's divisible (silver can be melted down into smaller units and recast into bigger units; you can't do that with cattle, which is why they don't make for good money). So if silver shares most properties with gold, why is it less valuable? Well perhaps the most important property of money is its scarcity. Silver is less valuable than gold, simply because it's not as scarce as gold. The more of something you have, the less valuable each unit of that thing becomes. Fiat money (Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Euros, etc.) are a terrible store of value, because governments are constantly stealing from us by inflating the money supply and devaluing it in the process. Fiat money is far from scarce. It used to be, when the world was on the gold standard. But all that changed in 1971. See [wtfhappenedin1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) for details.

So why is bitcoin better money? One reason is because it's the most scarce money to ever exist. It stores value energy — perfectly. It is impossible for any one to print more of it, and there are only 21 million bitcoins. The magic of Bitcoin is not that it can be sent instantaneously to someone a 1000 miles away but that it can be sent to someone a 1000 years away, because no one can devalue it by making or forging more of it. In fact the longer you keep it, the more the value of each unit grows, because demand for it will only continue to increase as it grows to be a trusted store of value.

The current financial system, on the other hand, is like a game where you had to work yourself bloody for hours just to get five points, while a small number of players have the ability to write themselves 1,000s of points. So all they do is sit and sip wine, frolicking with the judges of the game, while buying up all your labour with money they printed out of thin air. This game is a form of slavery. Instead of using violence and force, as tyrants did in the past, these slave owners now use fiat money to get others to their bidding. 

Our money is broken. Broken money steals our energy, our time, our life.  Cost of living, around the world, since 2020 has gone parabolic. And the fact is that if you're under the age of 35 you're significantly poorer than the generation that came before you. Thomas Jefferson tried to warn about this. He knew that a currency that could be printed out of thin air would rob the people blind. Hnery ford proposed a new type of currency, in 1921, completely backed by energy. He believed that energy backed currecny wil the ultimate form of money, not just promises in papre. He believed that engy backed money was an honest way for people to prove the work they had performed.

The closest we've gotten to a sound monetary system was when the world was on the gold standard. But gold has a major drawback. Alexander the Great galavanted around the world to seize gold. Titus Livy recounts Roman campaigns where gold and treasures were seized from enemies. Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul from 58 BCE to 50 BCE plundered vast amounts of gold from Gallic tribes to enrich Rome. Kublai Khan’s Mongol Empire looted immense gold from cities like Zhongdu and treasures from the Song Dynasty. In 1532, Francisco Pizarro captured the Incan emperor Atahualpa, demanding a gold ransom, only to execute him and take the gold for Spain. Hernán Cortés, during his conquest of the Aztecs from 1519 to 1521, seized gold from the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán. King Charles I of England, in the 17th century, seized gold and silver from nobles and the Church to fund his military campaigns. After defeating France in 1871, the Prussians took gold from the French Treasury as part of their war indemnity. In 1922, Lenin's Bolsheviks seized gold from the Church to fund the Soviet government. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt forced Americans to surrender their gold during the Great Depression to stabilize the economy. During the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Stalin took control of Spain's gold reserves to support the anti-fascist cause. In 1940, Winston Churchill took gold from European nations to protect it from Nazi occupation. In 1944, the U.S. established the Bretton Woods system, controlling global gold reserves, and in 1971, Nixon ended the gold standard, severing the link between the dollar and gold, effectively ending the gold-backed monetary system. Gold invites violence.

Bitcoin changes the dynamics of violence. It makes knowledge equal to ownership. For the first time in human history, man can own property that cannot be taken away by force. The keys are basically 12 words that can be memorised; and there are multiple and growing reports of people fleeing totalitarian states, like North Korea, for example, with the 12 words memorised. Only the owner of the keys to the wallet can control the coins within. And because one cannot conclusively know how much bitcoin a person really owns, and because one cannot take it by force, the only way for anyone to enrich themselves is to provide something of value to their fellow man. Thus, one has to visit their neighbour not with violence, but with an act of service or a gesture that brings mutual benefit. Bitcoin can and hopefully will end large-scale violence and war.

Our money represents our time, value, freedome, energy, our lives.  Bitcoin is the first engineered alternate money which is several orders of magnitude harder to shut down, to censor, to stop, and to manipulate than any other form of money used in the past. Buy bitcoin.

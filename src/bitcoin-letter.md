## Dear friends and family

If you don't own any bitcoin yet, buy some. I'll say it again. Buy some bitcoin. You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. You can buy a fraction of it.

Buy it with money you are willing to lose. Don't upgrade your phone or you laptop this year. Maybe give up one vacation, but buy some bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin is speculative. I wouldn't have to tell you about it were it not. But think of it this way. If Bitcoin achieves its goal (become global money), you'd have gained 10x to a 100x or more of what you put in (provided you buy some soon). If it fails, then you lose how much ever you were willing to lose in the first place. Bitcoin is the biggest asymmetrical bet you can make today. 

Now Bitcoin is not a get-rich scheme, although many look at it that way. It's much more than that. It's the most important invention since the printing press. And you don't want to be the last person holding a bag of worthless cash or investments while the rest of the world moves on to a superior money.

So, here's a bitcoin-buying strategy that I recommend (each step is explained in more detail below):

1. Using best practices, get a bitcoin wallet (explained below).
    
2. Buy a fraction of a bitcoin with money you are willing to lose; basically, put a small percentage of your investment portfolio in bitcoin. If you have no investments, now is a good time to start.
    
3. Do your research. Understand the technology behind Bitcoin. If you are convinced, then buy some more. But beware, the bitcoin rabbit-hole can quickly turn into a mind virus, captivate your imaginations, and consume your time.
    
4. _Optional_: Forget about bitcoin. Maybe you have more important things to do then to think about how money works. No problem. It's not a bad idea to buy some bitcoin and forget about the purchase (not your keys) until Bitcoin accomplishes its goal, i.e. when Bitcoin becomes a medium of exchange (when your employer starts paying you in bitcoin and your local kinara accepts it). Now many would advise starting with step 3, i.e., do you research, and then buy bitcoin. Sure, you could start with understanding the technology. But then start immediately. Stop putting it off. With each passing, it becomes less likely that you're gonna be able to purchase bitcoin at the undervalued price that it is at today.
    

## Get a bitcoin wallet

It's easy to shoot yourself in the foot when dealing with Bitcoin. I won't go into the details, because this is a letter, and there's tons of resources available online on how to safely create a wallet. I recommend you get yourself a desktop wallet like [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and even consider using a multisig setup like [this](https://freedomnode.com/blog/how-to-setup-a-secure-multisig-wallet-on-iphone-with-coldcard-tapsigner-and-nunchuk/). This can get complicated really fast, so feel free to reach out to me if you're having trouble.

After you create your wallet, it is imperative that you delete it and attempt to restore it using your keys (check the fingerprint to see if you've restored the right wallet). If you lose your keys, you have lost your bitcoin forever. There is no bank you can go to and recover the password. Because Bitcoin removes the middle-man, ownership comes with a cost — you have to be responsible for your keys. It's crucial that you know how to recover a wallet, and it's crucial that keep your keys (password) safe. Do not type it, do not take a picture, do not ever print it, and avoid storing it on anything digital. The easiest method of storing your keys is to write it down in a couple of notebooks, to be hidden in different locations (think different cities).

## Buy bitcoin

Once you have your wallet setup securely, buy some bitcoin. Now there are a lot of pitfalls to acquiring bitcoin. Whatever you do, do not link your wallet to your real-life identity. That means you do not register and buy your bitcoin from centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, WazirX, etc.), for such exchanges require your KYC (identity). They link your real life identity to your wallet. And you definitely do not want that. 

Buy Bitcoin directly from third-party traders who are willing to sell. You can find such traders on websites such as localbitcoins or hodlhodl or on decentralized exchanges such as bisq or robosats. All of this too can get complicated; so if you are not sure what you are doing, please reach out to me. I know a trustworthy dealer who might sell you some.

As a word of caution, there are a lot of crypto scams riding on Bitcoin's glory. Stay away form anything crypto that is not Bitcoin. We are in the early days of the blockchain technology, and there are a lot of scammers taking advantage of the lack of knowledge among people. In a free market, the economy will eventually tend to one money. For the very purpose of money is to increase the number of people you can trade with. The only reason why the silver was used during the gold standard was because it was difficult to scale gold. Bitcoin has no such problems and, therefore, needs no auxiliary money.

Finally, if you already own some bitcoins on some exchanges, then with the utmost urgency please withdraw them into your own custodial wallet. Remember the maxim: not your keys, not your bitcoins.

## Understand bitcoin

Now Bitcoin is not easy to understand, for it is multifaceted and at the crossroads of game theory, cryptography, computer science, networking and data transmission, and economic and monetary theory. There's a lot of reading you will have to do to fully understand the underlying technology. But here's a primer to help you intuitively understand the big picture.

Food stores calorie energy. If stored properly, it can hold calorie energy for a long time. Wood stores heat energy. If stored properly, it can store heat energy for a very long time. Tapes, CDs and mp3 files store sonic energy. Each have varying degrees of difficulty in storing sonic energy, but if stored properly, they can hold sonic energy for a significantly long period of time. Money stores value energy. It converts your labour (time and energy used productively to create value for someone else) into something (paper, metal, beads, salt, etc.) that you can later exchange for other goods and services. 

Fiat money (Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Euros, etc.) are terrible store of value because governments are constantly stealing from us by printing more of it, thereby, increasing the money supply, also known as inflation. Money loses its value as its supply increases. Why is silver less valuable than gold? Because it's not as scarce as gold. The more of something you have, the less valuable each unit of that thing becomes. 

Now Bitcoin is money. It stores value energy — perfectly. It is impossible for any one to print more of it, and there are only 21 million bitcoins. The magic of Bitcoin is not it can be sent instantaneously to someone a 1000 miles away but that it can be sent to someone a 1000 years away, because no one can devalue it by making or forging more of it. In fact the longer you keep it, the more the value of each unit grows because demand for it will only continue to increase as it grows to be a trusted store of value. Bitcoin is simply better money.

The current financial system is like a game where you had to work yourself bloody for hours just to get five points, while a small number of players have the ability to write themselves 1,000s of points. So all they do is sit and sip wine, frolicking with the judges of the game, and buy up all your labour with money they printed out of thin air. These financial elites, i.e., people that had the means to save in assets, either equities or real estate, are the only ones to benefit from this inflation. If you are a regular Joe working for cash, working for fiat money, and you didn't have the luxury to put money aside into assets the reality is that you were stolen from, your future, your labour, and your time was stolen from you.

This game is a form of slavery. Instead of using violence and force, as tyrants did in the past, these slave owners now use fiat money to get others to their bidding. Bitcoin is the first engineered alternate money which is several orders of magnitude harder to shut down, to censor, to stop, and to manipulate than any other form of money used in the past. At the beginning of 2020, the housing prices in the United States just went completely parabolic. And the reality is that if you're under the age of 35 you're significantly poorer than the generation that came before you,

The closest we've gotten to a sound monetary system was when the world was on the gold standard. But gold invites violence. Alexander the Great galavanted around the world to seize gold; Titus Livy tells the story of 1000 Roman sieges to steal gold; Caeser sacked Gaul to take their gold; Kublai Khan, emperor of the Mongol in the 1200s, seized gold; Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador captured Atahualpa, Emperor of the Inca in 1500s and seized gold; Hernan Cortes seized gold from the Aztecs; Charles I seized gold from all the British nobles; the Prussians seized gold from the French in 1871; Lenin seized gold from the church in 1922; Roosevelt seized gold from the Americans in 1933; Stalin seized thegold of the Spaniards in 1936; Churchill took everybody's gold in 1940 at the onset of the war; United States took the world's gold and took it hostage, and Nixon killed all the hostages in 1971. Everyone's seized everyone else's gold.

Titus Livy describes numerous Roman military campaigns to seize gold and treasures from defeated enemies like the Carthaginians, Gauls, and Germanic tribes. Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul from 58 BCE to 50 BCE not only expanded the Roman Empire but also led to the plundering of vast amounts of gold from Gallic tribes like the Helvetii, Belgae, and the Arverni, enriching Rome’s treasury. Kublai Khan’s Mongol Empire, during its invasions of China, Korea, and Central Asia, plundered enormous amounts of gold, especially after sacking cities like Zhongdu and capturing treasures from the Song Dynasty. In 1532, Francisco Pizarro captured the Incan emperor Atahualpa and demanded a ransom in gold, which the Incas delivered, only for Pizarro to execute Atahualpa and take the gold for Spain. Hernán Cortés, during his conquest of the Aztec Empire from 1519 to 1521, captured the Aztec emperor Montezuma II and looted immense amounts of gold from the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán, sending it back to Spain. In the 17th century, King Charles I of England, during a period of financial crisis, demanded loans and seized gold and silver from British nobles and the Church to fund his military campaigns, leading to widespread resentment. During the Franco-Prussian War, after defeating France in 1871, the Prussians seized gold from the French Treasury as part of the war indemnity, which included a payment of 5 billion francs to the German Empire. In 1922, following the Russian Revolution, Lenin and the Bolsheviks confiscated gold and other valuable resources from the Russian Orthodox Church and religious institutions, in an effort to fund the fledgling Soviet government. In 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring American citizens to surrender their gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the federal government, as part of efforts to stabilize the economy during the Great Depression. During the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union took control of gold reserves belonging to the Spanish Republican government, moving the gold to the Soviet Union to fund the anti-fascist cause. In 1940, as World War II loomed, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill took gold reserves from countries across Europe, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, to safeguard them from Nazi occupation and to bolster the British war effort. In 1944, the United States established the Bretton Woods system, effectively controlling global gold reserves by pegging currencies to the U.S. dollar, and in 1971, President Richard Nixon ended the gold standard, severing the dollar's convertibility into gold and "killing" the international gold-backed monetary system.

During the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Stalin took control of Spain's gold reserves to support the anti-fascist cause. In 1940, Winston Churchill took gold from European nations to protect it from Nazi occupation. In 1944, the U.S. established the Bretton Woods system, controlling global gold reserves, and in 1971, Nixon ended the gold standard, severing the link between the dollar and gold, effectively ending the gold-backed monetary system. Gold invites violence.

Bitcoin changes the dynamics of violence. It makes knowledge equal to ownership. For the first time in the history, man can own property that cannot be taken away by force. Only the person who has the keys to the wallet can control the coins in that wallet. And because one cannot conclusively know how much bitcoin a person really owns, and because one cannot take it by force, the only way for anyone to enrich themselves is to provide something of value to their fellow man. Bitcoin has the potential to end large-scale violence and war.
